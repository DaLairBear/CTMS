# CTMS

This Project is to build a Demo Clinical Trial Management System that can be used to build E-Source for Clinical Trials.

I want to build a Coordinator friendly UX/UI that allows the entry of data to be clean, consise and easy to use and prevent the miscapture of data.
Further more to allow study data to be easily acessiable and readable to study overseers and the FDA.

To begin this project I will work on the User Experience for Coordinators and build views based on an example study start up documentation and physical source forms.
Designing a UI that is is the most imperative aspect of this project as coordinators/providers are the for most users of this program.
Making a system that they find easy to use to input data that is fast and reactive will always be the priority.

Once a user interface is mocked up a stack will be decided upon to decide to promote the utmost efficiency of the user end and data capture/access.
